- Module Four of Four, of [[ProNextJs.dev Course Review]]
-
- Intro: [Next.js React Server Component (RSC) Architecture](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk)
	- going into caching strats, file uploads, architecture
-

-
- ## Caching in Depth
- Caching apis:
  id:: 66d0a8fc-395d-4185-a423-44694d1d26d4
	- unstable_noStore()
	- headers()
	- cookies()
	- export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"
	- export const revalidate = 2 // Time between being revalidated
	- revalidatePath and revalidateTag
-
- [Next.js API Route Caching](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/next-js-api-route-caching-adpb7)
	- feels like this vid was meant to be the third one in
		- module ends with: "that covers the full route cache and how it applies to pages and routes"
	- next automatically caches api routes that don't perform actions that would prevent caching
	- if you want them dynamic, you [have some options](((66d0a8fc-395d-4185-a423-44694d1d26d4)))
	- POST/PUT/DEL are automatically dynamic (because they act on data)
-
- [Caching with the Next.js App Router](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/caching-with-the-next-js-app-router-dtpj1)
	- This seems like it should have been the first video in this sectiontal
	- talks about the first one we're going to look at is the full route cache
-
- [The Full Route Cache](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/the-full-route-cache-lc3dt)
  id:: 66cfc882-85cd-4ba3-a3a5-c46e3e9e06c3
	- routes are either static or dynamic
	- the ==build output== will show which routes are dynamic `f` vs static `O`
	- `unstable_noStore()` tells next the route should be dynamic
		- access properties of the request also
-
- [Cache-busting with Tags](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/cache-busting-with-tags-nj1x5)
	- next.js's unstable_cache is a persistent cache between requests
	- shows how to specifically cache a thing, then invalidate that cache thing
	- `getData = unstable_cache(getREALData)`
	- Then you can trigger a function to revalidate the cached data on the server
	- have to associate the cache with a tag (the first arg is actually just the name)
	- `revalidateTag`
	- üí¨‚ÅâÔ∏è: This sentence reads funny:
		- > Back in the¬†`page.tsx`¬†file, we'll being in the button and use the¬†`revalidateTag`¬†function to revalidate the cache:
		- the last code block uses getDBTimeReal() but imports only `getDBTime`
-
- [Dynamic Routes in Next.js](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/dynamic-routes-in-next-js-pf2le)
	- do dynamic things to keep a route dynamic
	- like reading headers / cookies, or useSearchParams on the client
	- export const dynamic = "force-dynamic" | "static"
-
- [Data Caching and Revalidation with React Server Components](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/data-caching-and-revalidation-with-react-server-components-pkgrz)
	- next caches data from fetches: shows an example with a second background express server (separate api)
	- "the DATA cache"
	- üí¨‚ÅâÔ∏è: "so in my IRC" -> "so in my RSC"
	- `fetch: cache: no-store`
	- next.revalidate = "2"  on the fetch call
	- or you can "revalidatePath()"
	- or you can revalidate by tag again
-
- [The Next.js Router Cache](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/the-next-js-router-cache-tkm4i)
	- there is a client side cache: "the ROUTER cache"
	- if you revisit a route it can be loaded from the cache super fast
	- some distinction between the "route cache" and the "router cache"
		- router is client side
		- route is the server output from build that highlights dynamic vs static paths ([see "route cache" above](((66cfc882-85cd-4ba3-a3a5-c46e3e9e06c3))))
	- üí¨‚ÅâÔ∏è:  "It's never been an issue with the router cache, it's only an issue with the router cache."
	- when a server action is executed, the client posts to the server with a specific header, then server runs with that action and responds
	- ==router.push(newRoute)== and ==router.refresh()== typically the üçû and üßà of your router interactions
-
- [Automatic and Manual Revalidation](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/automatic-and-manual-revalidation-wpddq)
	- automatic based on time: `export const revalidate = timeInSeconds`
	- manual revalidation can be triggered via `revalidatePath()`
	- "Next, we'll talk about how this full-route caching approach affects API routes."
		- okay, so the first module was last apparently
-
- ## Application Architecture Options
- #+BEGIN_NOTE
  Almost all of these
  #+END_NOTE
-
- [Understanding the Example Monorepo Structure](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/understanding-the-example-monorepo-structure-4gpny)
	- talking through the repo structure for the next couple sections
	- [client-and-server/03-systems-architecture at main ¬∑ ProNextJS/client-and-server](https://github.com/ProNextJS/client-and-server/tree/main/03-systems-architecture)
	- includes examples for `local`, `bff`, and `external`
	- couple of simulated micro services: rest, gql, or twerp script‚ùó
-
- [Intro to Systems Architecture](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/intro-to-systems-architecture-ivz9q)
	- introducing architectures
		- **local:** single client -> nextjs -> db
		- **BFF**: nextjs is backend for frontend. Client -> next -> microservices -> db
			- most common architecture when you have microservices internally
		- **External**: Client -> (nextjs -> microservices) -> db
-
- ## Local Architectures
- [The API Route Variant of Local Systems](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/the-api-route-variant-of-local-systems-ewm5a)
	- local api INSTEAD OF using server actions
	- sets up api/todo/route.ts: The route gets the todos if authed or errors
	- note: seems annoying to be checking the auth separately in each of the verbs
-
- [Building with Local Server Actions in Next.js](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/building-with-local-server-actions-in-next-js-l0mn2)
	- ok, same demo but using server actions instead of client side api calls
-
- ## BFF Architectures
- [BFF Architecture with GraphQL](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/bff-architecture-with-graph-ql-e20oo)
	- this time the next app talks to a graphql api
	- controlled rest api between client and next, graph between next and gql
	- setting up api routes with next which translate the calls
	- proxies the cookie over with `getContext`
	- really good if you have a gql backend
-
- [Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Architecture with Server Actions](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/backend-for-frontend-bff-architecture-with-server-actions-fcoc0)
	- doing all the api calls to a rest endpoint from the RSC
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è noted: seems odd to be running the fetch requests in sequence rather than parallel
	- server actions make the whole thing pretty simple
-
- [The API Variant of Backend-for-Frontend Architecture](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/the-api-variant-of-backend-for-frontend-architecture-l102h)
	- sets up an api route that proxies to a backend rest route
	- notes that the jwt isn't encrypted, just makes the example easier
		- (stuff like this bugs me: show me how to do it properly rather than leave me with an incomplete solution)
		- afaict the complication is mostly in making sure the api server can handle the encrypted jwt that would be forwarded
-
- [BFF Pattern with gRPC (TwirpScript)](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/bff-pattern-with-g-rpc-twirp-script-qfuhk)
	- (only exciting to me because of those clients I have with grpc microservices)
	- not using grpc directly (a hassle to set up üòõ)
	- twirpscript has same rpc archicture but is easier to work with
	- rpc calls in this example are between nextjs (server actions) and the "grpc server"
	- synchronizing the protos through the monorepo
	- (sending an unencrypted jwt through the stack again üòÖ)
-
- [BFF Architecture with tRPC](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/bff-architecture-with-t-rpc-ve20t)
	- shows a trpc setup between client and nextjs
	- callTodoService is a rest fetch call between next and backend
	-
- ## External Architectures
- [Server Architecture with an External API Domain](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/server-architecture-with-an-external-api-domain-08y9s)
	- local next site runs at myco.com, but talks to api.myco.com for getting data
	- talks directly to api when mutating data
	- api needs to webhook the next server to reset caches
-
- [Proxying External Systems with Next.js](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/proxying-external-systems-with-next-js-8vtpt)
	- includes rewrites in the next config to proxy an entire endpoint to a different service
	- then the client calls through api routes that transparently travel (headers and all) to that rewritten path
	- it's literally bypassing the next paths and redirecting them to the proxied server _directly_
	- reminds me of proxying endpoints with create react app
-
- [Token Variation of the External Systems Architecture](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/token-variation-of-the-external-systems-architecture-xgidd)
	- client given a token that is used with the api
	- starting with proxying the rest paths to local:5002
	- storing the token on the session
	- notes at the end about the token being linked to the client
		- good alternate approach is to proxy through next and store the bearer token on the next server
-
- ## Streaming and Suspense
- [Intro to Suspense and Streaming in Next.js](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/intro-to-suspense-and-streaming-in-next-js-wd2ud)
	- 'embarrassment of riches' üòÖ
		- (the subs showed "next js is an embarrassment..." initially)
	- previewing an app where the data (rendered on the server) takes a long time
	- Use suspense to ensure the page isn't a blocking white screen
	- `<Suspense fallback={...}>`
-
- [Adding Suspense to the Application](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/adding-suspense-to-the-application-e3euh)
	- shows his example, working with a loading indicator, super simple
	- Challenge: can we make this more granular? Load them individually?
	- Gives a hint to use the react `use` hook: [use ‚Äì React](https://react.dev/reference/react/use)
		- this is good! I haven't used `use` yet, but it's surprisingly straightforward
		- ‚ùáÔ∏è you can `use(aContext)` (rather than useContext that is subject to additional rules of hooks)
		- ‚ö†Ô∏è ...searches upwards and does not consider context providers in the component from which you‚Äôre calling use(context).
- [Granular Suspense in React](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/granular-suspense-in-react-nyxhj)
	- Breaking through the example:
		- removes the top level suspense and instead wraps each item in one
		- creates a sub component with the `use` hook to unwrap promises individually
	- (with the `loading...` fallback it's kind of jumpy, but this would look great with skeletons)
-
- ## Advanced Topics
- [DIY Streaming with Server Actions](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/diy-streaming-with-server-actions-e6tx5)
	- stocks example with server actions!
	- makes the main dashboard into a client component that calls the server action then handles the results
	- runs into an error regarding the component not being in the manifest
		- because of the way the components passed around next forgets to include it
		- shows a work around: import and maybe assign the component somewhere (even if you don't use it) just to keep it in the bundle
	- end result is streaming UI: it's all one request but the first portion of the UI is sent and rendered right away
	- üòï seems odd to put the client component in the middle, but I suppose that's how you get the suspense boundary to the client first (otherwise the page is blocking)
-
- [Cached Server Actions in Next.js](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/cached-server-actions-in-next-js-ve3rl)
	- üö©Oh no: mentions his friends at Haaretz in Isreal.
		- (Is Jack a zionist / sympathizer? üíî )
		- This should be removed. It doesn't add anything to the content of the video, he could just say "I know a company that uses this approach" and leave the country out of it.
		- it's gonna ruffle some feathers otherwise, given the ongoing genocide taking place in Israel
	- Used it for caching portions of their content site
	- using server actions for caching:
		- client component makes a server action request
		- action returns either rendered html, or client components to render
		- client component renders the content
	- how server actions work:
		- client makes a post request with a special header: `Next-Action`
		- Server sees header and executes action instead of normal request
	- the rest of this example includes a bunch of patching fetch, but also a new hook `useCacheableServerAction`
-
- [File Uploads in Next.js App Router Apps](https://www.pronextjs.dev/workshops/next-js-react-server-component-rsc-architecture-jbvxk/file-uploads-in-next-js-app-router-apps-vqozo)
	- going through file uploads! (ofc)
	- server action example
		- using a server action for the first example: easily get the file from formdata and writes to public dir
		- uses RSC to display the picture afterward
		- (needs to revalidate the path after the file is written -- üëçüèªthis is drilled into us by now I think)
	- API example
		- gets the formdata / file from the post request
		- and of course, has to revalidate path again
		- the api request doesn't automatically refresh, had to also do a router.refresh()
