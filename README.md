## General Notes

- If you click away from the workshops ~~it's not obvious how to get back to them~~ (no global nav?) --
	- I found the url `/workshops` based on pages open in other tabs
	- **sometime mid week the "Pro Workshops" menu item started to show up ☺️**
- Clicking around at the general structure of the site
	- I really like the feedback widget for sending quick feedback on stuff 👍🏻
	- Really like the widescreen layout, and the full written vs transcript being included 👍🏻
- ~~lots of spinners on the player, couldn't always get consistent playback~~
	- no, this is a me browser issue, something is up with arc vid playback across all pages rn
	- safari is smooth tho
- nit: Theme defaults to light: might be cool to default to system instead (punch in the face for us dark users)
- There are a bunch of subtle mistranslations in the transcripts that could be fixed up
	- do a codebase wide search and replace for "App Writer" (app router)
	- I call it out in individual lessons where I noticed issues (look for "💬 ⁉️")
- Section three and four get into some very specific examples
	- It's good to have examples showing different architectural use cases
	- Definitely beefs out the "professional next.js" title
